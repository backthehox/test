These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.\n\nIt is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through **OS Credential Dumping**. Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller.\n\nIn cloud and/or containerized environments, authenticated user and service account credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files. They may also be found as parameters to deployment commands in container logs. In some cases, these files can be copied and reused on another machine or the contents can be read and then used to authenticate without needing to copy any files.\r\n\r\n## Attack-pattern: Unsecured Credentials\r\n\r\nAdversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. **Bash History**), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. **Credentials in Registry**),  or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. **Private Keys**).', 'ttps': {'id': 'attack-pattern--7f1a468f-3a5e-4917-bef5-0d2099b8cef5', 'type': 'attack-pattern', 'name': 'Unsecured Credentials', 'description': 'Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.
